Password Locker is an application that helps users generate and store passwords on their multiple accounts.
The password locker runs as a terminal application and uses short codes to navigate through it.
A user can:
* Create a new user.
* Log in to an existing user (Username = test & Password = t3st for test data.)
* Remove a saved user.
* 
When the user is logged in, they can:
* Add new credentials
* Store an existing credential in the passlock.
* View all the stored credentials.
* Delete a saved credential.

The user also has an option of inputting a password or autogenerating a password
